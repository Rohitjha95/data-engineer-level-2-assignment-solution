# Taxi Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the extraction, processing, and analysis of taxi trip data from the year 2019. It includes tasks such as data extraction, cleaning, transformation, loading into an SQLite database, and generating insights through SQL queries and visualizations.

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- SQLite

## Running the Project
1. **Data Extraction**: Run `download_data.py` to fetch CSV files for the year 2019.
2. **Data Processing**: Execute `process_data.py` to clean, transform, and aggregate the data.
3. **Data Loading**: Use `load_data_to_sqlite.py` to load processed data into an SQLite database.
4. **Data Analysis**: Perform SQL queries to derive insights and generate visualizations (`Sql_queries_and_generate_reports.py`).

## Data Analysis
- **SQL Queries and Visualization**: The Sql_queries_and_generate_reports.py file contains SQL queries to answer specific questions about taxi usage and create visualizations based on query results.
